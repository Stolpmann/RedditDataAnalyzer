|I don't think there is a right answer here, but I would say that as long as you beat inflation and can be close the the S&amp;P 500 returns, you are doing well. Of course some people make a lot more than that, but their risk tolerance is a lot higher. 6-8% is good enough for most. I personnally go for 15%+ returns.|

|I've read those studies, but average isn't good enough.   Bus passes aren't expensive and there are programs that buy them and in every state I've lived in, they are discounted for students.  They pale in comparison to the horrendous cost of school and are probably about the lowest priority.  Universal healthcare should absolutely be optional.  Malpractice kills 175k people a year in the US(per Johns Hopkins), diet and exercise are optional, eating fast food, smoking, drugs and drinking are optional.  If you're forcing someone to pay for you then you should be forced to try everything to decrease your burden first, fair is fair.  Not to mention, diet and exercise are vastly more beneficial and would help everyone anyway.  

If you could buy insurance as I pointed out, without being denied, and you're only paying wholesale cost(what government pays) it is easily covered.  I would also change social security into a Roth IRA, which covers healthcare without penalties and gives a much much higher ROI than SSI, but that is an entire thread in itself. 

Basically, its about 8 million vs 450k which would definitely cover the vast majority of people for college, home down payments and healthcare(all things Roth iras can pay without penalty).|

|Roads was just an example to illustrate why it wouldn't work. Here's a more removed example then. My old university gives everyone an affordable bus pass. They decided to make it an option to "opt-out", if you want to (most people are too lazy to opt out, so these systems get higher participation than opt-in programs). People who never use the bus opt-out, which lowers funding but does not decrease the cost to the system. The bus pass price went up about 50%, making it less affordable for all the students who need it and regularly use the bus. 

&gt;It's completely viable to make some programs optional

Sure, some programs could be optional. But not healthcare.

|We sell lumber to US and then they sell it back to us as a mark up. When the pandemic hit and the border closed, Americans jacked up prices of our own lumber using many non existent issues to justify it. Many friends who drive trucks and take the lumber across the border told me they drop the lumber of only for another truck to be loaded with it and brought back to Canada usually the same day. 

This sort of garbage happens in other forms as well, such as with oil, except with oil the Americans at least refine it. I dunno know why the government does this, there is no reason for us to do any of this, but both the Liberals and conservatives have allowed Americans to screw us like this for decades.|
|Housing prices are inversely correlated with interest rates. I'll take 7% interest (hell, 12%) if it means buying a house for $250,000 instead of $500,000.

It takes less time to save a downpayment, and you can pay off the principal in a shorter timeframe if home prices are lower - any windfalls or savings can be early repayments that hammer down a higher percentage of the principal.

Low interest is *punishing* to savers, rewarding to the indebted.|

|Great breakdown. Housing developments started to  boom near me (for obvious reasons) which seemed like a great thing... now however with the insane rise in building materials, projects are being shutdown or simply the cost of building has gone up dramatically.


My point is that some portion of the housing price increase is now due to material cost and not strictly supply and demand of the housing market.

A house closing for 300k a few years ago, might literally cost 450k to build now and with the new found demand, sells for 500-600k (play numbers)|

They would also run more efficiently if they had to validate their funding.

|Respected financial author William Bernstein long ago published an article titled [The 15-Stock Diversification Myth](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm). The excerpt of relevance:

&gt;...a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few "superstocks" like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn‚Äôt have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.

&gt; ...

&gt; So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. It‚Äôs just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.

**TL;DR**: you are taking an outsize risk by NOT diversifying. Yeah, you increase your chance of getting wealthy...and VASTLY increase your chance of dying poor.

|The way capital gain works is that you are taxed on 50% of your profit. Ie: if I invest 5k today, and it turns into 7. I have to pay tax on half of the 2k profit. So I'm taxed as if I made an extra 1k. At whatever tax rate I am paying for income that year.

There are ways to pay less but it depends on your situation. You can invest it into an rsp for a tax deferral. You can claim capital losses, if you have any, to offset the tax of your capital gains. You can CREATE capital losses with the intent of offsetting capital gains and then rebuy them after you file.

There's lots of things you can do but not all of them will apply in your situation. And not all of them are things you necessaeily even want to do. I would do some research on how capital gain works and what affects it.|
|Maybe I'm wrong here but. Lump sum winning implies you can time the market. Which let's be honest. Most people who try to do this fail.

Lump sum wins on the basis of having more money in market earlier. If I invest 10k today vs 1k/mo for 10 months. That's a no brainer. But that has nothing to do with the price of the stock.

|Depends on your goals. Index funds are considered the safe play. Picking your own stocks comes with a load of risk.

What's your purpose for investing? You're 18 so if you lose everything now you can make it back without too much trouble. Not that you should. Just saying, you can have a way higher risk tolerance than someone in say their 40s.

|If you want to active trade but don't like day trading I'd look into something called swing trading. It's like a middle ground between day and long term investing.

If that's still not your thing, index funds are easy. When you said short to mid term I was imaging like a year or two, but it sounds like you're investing for retirement.

3x ETFs are designed for short short term trading. Long term you're so overleveraged you will lose out over a normal etf most of the time.

|I like GRT, but it is expensive (check price to NAV). I look for REITs which are trading at large discounts to NAV and are likely to recover back to or above NAV. Capital gains have the lowest tax rate so that amplifies the NET result. Distributions to me are taxes at much higher rates.

There are a lot of lower quality REITs out there with large discounts. Finding Quality at discounts is always the goal.|

|Noob question i didnt think deserves its own thread. 

Im 28, and just started investing a small amount of my savings with a wealthsimple tfsa. 

I honestly dont know much about what im doing and am investing a lot on speculation with companies that i think have room for growth in the future/will recover from covid. Im doing this with money i can afford to lose if things go wrong, but want to invest a larger chunk of my savings into something like an etf that i dont need to be worried about managing. 

I am ok with high risk, and plan to park this money for a fairly long time. Is there much of a point in investing in a variety of etfs? Or should i just dump that portion into either veqt/xeqt? 

I was looking at spreading it into a few different etfs with different focuses but am i just overthinking things there given that those funds should have a variety of stocks under them?|
Have you heard of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT's) like ticker VNQ which provide you with exposure to US real estate and always pay healthy distributions from rental income.

|These three I believe are high quality, and will have the best capital gains over the next 12 months. I would definitely recommend you do your due diligence on them and see if they would be a good addition to your portfolio. 

AP.UN, FCR.UN are two other quality REITs worth looking into, but I believe the capital gains will be less lucrative.|

Because this makes the system unviable. Low risk groups opt out, making it unaffordable for the poor people who actually need it in the first place.

Canada doesn't even do that.   
If I was a part of some political family in India which was stealing money, do you know how easy it would be for them to send the money to me in Canada? There would be literally no questions asked!

I agree with it. We already have this mechanism for personal taxes (foreign tax credit is dollar-for-dollar and if less than Canadian payable taxes you pony up).

|In jest, and just to make fun of a fun hypothetical situation, what's the point of maxing a retirement account? It'll be a tax deferral at the max marginal rate, only to pay it in the future at the max marginal rate, which is more likely to be higher than lower. I suppose there's the tax-free compounding for decades from a pure efficiency perspective. But that's probably less than 0.5% of the $70M. I guess this is why wealth managers earn their dollar lol|

[OP - Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/06/05/g7-tax-us-yellen/) 
&gt; The G-7 group of advanced economies announced an historic accord to set a minimum global corporate tax rate on Saturday, taking a first step to reverse a four-decade decline in the taxes paid by multinational corporations.

[Reuters - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/g7-nations-near-historic-deal-080128063.html) 
&gt; The United States, Britain and other large, rich nations reached a landmark deal on Saturday to squeeze more money out of multinational companies such as Amazon and Google and reduce their incentive to shift profits to low-tax offshore havens.

Ironically the former written by Washington Post which is owned by Amazon's Jeff Bezos wrote a more favourable article on this -- but holy crap the editorializing in the latter is stark.|

|In this environment where reits are 20% off and local real estate is sky high, I agree this is insane.

|No they are totally giving you shares for free. 

Of course it‚Äôs a glitch.|
|I don't know where you feel I don't understand acb or dca. The concept of an average goes much further than the financial industry. My point all along was if the share is $15 you pay $15 for it. Your argument was you only pay $12.50 and get a discount because you own previous shares. That is incorrect. You still pay $15 for the ones you're purchasing on that day. What you are trying to describe is your acb, which would be lower if you previously bought at $10.

Ps... The A in acb stands for adjusted not average. While most of the time it is a simple average, it can get a little more complicated if, for example, you get a dividend payment that has ROI in it. Drips can also complicate acb calculations in a taxable account because your broker will not show the proper book cost and it's on you to make sure it's correct.|

| You are right about Canada being small potatoes. 

I was just stipulating that we are in a critical time. Andslither housing collapse AT THIS TIME could be the straw that breaks the camels back. 

But I‚Äôm certainly not hoping for anything drastic. Canada is supposed to be the stable nation|
|No I think it's more like how the US taxes their citizens who don't live in the US. Americans who live and work in other countries are still supposed to file and pay taxes to the US. However they have credit and exceptions for those people so most Americans living and working in Canada don't actually pay any US taxes. So it's not that difficult to set up a similar system.

Lets use Apple and Ireland for an example. Apple sends all their profits to Ireland under a shell company, and pays Ireland their taxes(12.5% I think) Canada can say wait, you only paid 12.5% to Ireland, so the profits you had in Canada, you owe us 2.5%.(I'm just using these for an example of how I think the system could work. It may not be like this at all, but since something similar has already been done, it's not hard to imagine them creating a similar system)|

|It's one year from the draw to claim it, takes a month or so to change your name(I think for the name part)|
|That's what I mean, I would be putting about 60mil into VGRO and that will give you over 1mil in distribution payout yearly, plus it will most likely grow at close to 5mil yearly. So what else do you want? Plus you have 10mil in bank account as emergency and to just live very well for like 20 years!|

|As a general rule of thumb, I don‚Äôt like the ones whose charts show them historically trading sideways. I.e. The first three you mentioned with REI, SRU, and HR.

That said, the aforementioned and almost every other REIT is still recovering from COVID-19, so all are good investments until they at least surpass Dec-Feb 2020 levels!|
VFV is Canadian stocks of course you can. I'm saying that most big companies can be found in US exchange market than in TSX. QT is useful if you use your registered account because it converts CAD to USD compared WS.
Questrade has free etf purchases which is what the two you mentioned are. Only Individual stocks carry the $5 fee.
|Yes, my mistake|
|Wow. That is possibly the best breakdown of the issue that I have seen to date. Thank you for sharing. 

The numbers make me both concerned for my children and comfortable with having recently purchased during covid. The trouble is I don't see a viable solution. Having been involved in custom home building in the past, I can say that it's a nightmare on many levels. The worst was dealing with the permit process, but it was nearly as bad dealing with contractors. So many are busy straight up scam artists, don't have a clue what they're doing, or otherwise charge too much because they are actually legitimate and know what the rest of the pool is like. 

I never considered for some reason that even the immigrant numbers who rent will have an impact on housing. Scarcity in rentals drive those prices up as well. It's a lose lose situation on either side of the fence right now.|

|In short.  If your in core GTA or Vancouver, yo'ure going to be fine and I wouldn't worry about being expensive because you're priced in already.  These two markets are safe.  Any other market, I would recommend you rent and find something discount from someone looking to liquidate.  Lots of pundits worried, its all scare tactics designed to sell clicks.  Financial have been whacked for YEARS already.  You can't stop playing the game because yo'ure worried about an inevitable crash and for everyone to say I told you so.  That's not how this works. Play aggressive but pick your spots, and keep residual cash on hand to make plays if the market crashes.  During covid Billionaires INCREASED their wealth more than any other class.  Why?  Because they take risks and buy in crazy times at discounted prices.|

|For sure, there will be slightly more supply in certain situations.

Also when i point out the immigration numbers, it doesnt matter if they buy or rent. I look at it as additional homes that people will need, period. Both the rental and buying markets are super tight, and have been for a while. So no matter which one they go to, they will contribute to overwhelming demand. 

I had an old post about supply numbers, ill copy/paste

_______

I could only find Canada wide FTHB stats, rather than Ontario only, but ive backed into a range below.

There are about 250k first time home buyers per year across Canada. If even 10% of those 250K were for Ontario (likely way higher than 10%, probably closer to 30-35%, but lets choose 10% to be conservative) then that would represent new domestic demand of 25k/year (88K if we use 35%). Coming at it another way, about 8.9% of households surveyed in Ontario as part of the 2018 census bought their house in the last 5 years, so 1.8% per year on average in first-time home buyer purchases. So if we look at total households in Ontario per 2016 census of 5.1M, 1.8% of that per year is 91K of demand (very similar to my previous calculation with 35%).

So we have demand of 40k from immigrants (assuming 2.9 people per household as you state, ignoring that more than half of units built in Ontario are coming from apartments/condos, many of which will be two bedroom or less), plus a range of domestic demand of 12k-50k (i divided my numbers above by two for shits and giggles), and that puts us at needing 52k to 90k new homes built each year. We build 40K. Even at the low end, being 12K units short (30% short) each year is a compounding problem that will undoubtedly result in run-away housing prices over time.

No matter how you slice it, there are simply not enough homes/roofs/etc for people to buy, so people are fighting over whatever is available, hence the sharp increases we have seen over the last 5-10 years.

Ive been trying to buy a precon property in the last 18 months, have filled out many worksheets, obtained many bank drafts, but i never get allocated a unit because the demand is insane. On the resale side, i think we all know that low inventory and bidding wars are still a thing, and have spread to many other smaller cities. Anecdotal yes, but these housing prices are being driven by demand. Demand of people wanting a roof over their hands. People are buying to live. Either you overbid and get ahead of market prices or you dont get a house and spend a lot of time doing the same thing over and over. So people just overbid and pay it off over 25/30 years because they just want to get something and move on with their lives and want to get themselves/their families settled.

Now on the supply side, i agree that things need to be easier to build. But i think the core problem is availability of labour to do so. Developers/builders can only build so many things at once, and finding people is already a struggle at current supply levels. I dont know how you could measurably increase annual supply without addressing the huge labour issue.|
|Some country's economies are built on being tax havens. That's how they attract new investors. I don't think they'll say okay if USA + EU decide that they should tax everyone more. Maybe they'll ask to only tax big corpo, but I don't really think such a great arm reach will ever happen.|

|Any REIT that has 100% of its portfolio in office buildings is a no go for me.  Fine for a short term trade, but bad for an investment - the trends are not their friend in any meaningful way whatsoever.|
|I'm from the US, so you have to forgive me, I think we have different laws and procedures.  Civil Court has a hearing and burden of proof here(preponderance of the evidence) the government here makes crazy decisions with no checks or balances and you have governmental immunity from lawsuits. 

  For instance, my local city government sold 5 acres valued at a few million for 45$ to a developer of their choosing.  The public even signed a petition and they ignored it.  You couldn't do anything like that in civil court here, but our legal process is certainly flawed heavily as well.   I've spent 16 years working in it and it's very broken.   

I'm fine with a structure of society, I'm not really ok with a small group deciding the structure for the masses.  I am not a libertarian either, I mentioned that I wasn't saying "0 taxes!" In my first post.   I don't think there are only two options and I don't think the 2 options we pretend exist are anywhere close to the best for most citizens.   

Take universal healthcare for an example, everyone acts like you either have to have full UH or none.   Why not just have an optional government healthcare that can't deny anyone, splits costs evenly and anyone that wants it can buy in?  What's so terrible about that?  

I think many things fall under that umbrella of thought.|

|I 1000% agree that government transparency is paramount. And I actually appreciate libertarian opposition that seeks to keep the government honest and in check.

&gt; What if the political party you disagree with was always in power, would you still support 100% of taxes and programs?

Fortunately I can relate to this! Last year in Alberta we recently had our government spend $1.5 billion on a pipeline-to-nowhere (keystone xl). For reference, our annual income taxes raise $11-12billion. I‚Äôm furious about this, but I‚Äôm in no way opposed to the government‚Äôs *right* to mismanage taxpayer dollars this way. I will be campaigning vehemently for the opposition party next election. 

I AM however opposed to the way that the publicly-funded $30 million/year ‚ÄúAlberta oil war-room‚Äù has been structured as a private company to be insulated from freedom of information requests. There again though, I don‚Äôt blame this boondoggle on the *idea* of government spending.

&gt; How is forcing people to pay for anything "just"?

This is literally the entire purpose of civil court, to force people to pay money, and honour their agreements for the sake of justice.

The money in my pocket doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúproperty of Oldcadillac‚Äù on it, it says ‚ÄúBank of Canada‚Äù, the State made it, the state has a de facto monopoly of violence to do what it wants with that money, including taking some of it back in the form of taxes. My wife is Bermudian, I could probably move there and pay no income taxes, but it wouldn‚Äôt make economic sense because my skill set is much more valuable here so by staying here I‚Äôm de facto consenting to the basic structure of the society even though I‚Äôm working to make it better and more just.|

Say X country imports their lumber, metal, food, medicine etc etc from G7 X, Y, Z, but doesnt agree to the 15% to the one big company, then G7 X, Y, Z could start charging 15% each to the imported goods forcing country X to agree to the 15% at the big company.|

|I did see an earlier comment of bigger countries covering the difference (ireland taxing 12.5% and canada taxing the same company 2.5% additional) i think this would then lead to canada being able to go at ireland for that tax difference on other goods and services to make up for the loss, either forcing their govt to sign on to the treaty and raising to 15% or continue paying higher taxes on goods and services?

|I use roads, I said I don't drive often but pay for them.  I didn't say I wouldn't pay for roads, I think you misread something.  How is forcing people to pay for anything "just"?  I think it's funny that you're arguing a subjective stance though, which is exactly why it is wrong.   What if the political party you disagree with was always in power, would you still support 100% of taxes and programs?  Nobody I've ever voted for has won anything, and again,  I'm not supporting 0 taxes either.   I don't think it's logical or correct to assume the government spends wisely. 

It's weird, businesses seem to meet demand just fine... it's almost like their product is worth purchasing.  Rand Paul has an entire speech where he covers government programs that are obviously a gigantic waste of money.   

   You know about 0 about my life, so your assumptions are ok, but I buy almost everything local from farmers and live very frugally.  My family works from home and we live 3 miles from everything except the airport.  I doubt I'll drive 2,000 miles this entire year.  I am definitely below average for consumption and travel, and again, I pay for roads.

|Generally you don't want to spend more than 30% of your take home pay on rent/mortgage.

Good investment practice also predicates saving 20%+ of your take home pay to investing (outside the real estate market)

75k means roughly 54k take home pay depending on your province of course.

So $108k household income after taxes. That's $9000 monthly income combined after taxes. (More like 10 months of $8,307.69 and two months of $12,461.54 assuming bi-weekly pay)

And this is assuming no further interest rate increases past 3-4%.

So unless, a person enjoys potentially living the house poor lifestyle, yes that's cutting it close.|

It very well could bounce back.  I'm actually thinking it will at some point but it certainly won't be based on strong fundamentals.  It's very much momentum based.
I think you‚Äôre way too spread IMO
|The answer has to be "yes i'll use services I didn't pay for" , and "no i won't deny others" because otherwise the question has to shift to how much do you pay to be allowed to use those services... and then it stops being a public service and becomes a private one.

The only way I can think of it working would be that you would have to have defined buckets of programs, defined in like a list of 10-20 or so that people can easily understand - each bucket would clearly have several actual buckets in it.   (example.   Transportation Infrastructure,  Educational Services,   Healthcare Services,  National Debt, etc).   You would then do your taxes as you normally do now - except when at the end your total yearly tax was calculated, half would be equally spread over all buckets and half would be distributed into those various buckets by you. 

Each bucket would have a "funded" and "fully funded" level (picked by the gov of the day),   once a bucket hits "fully funded" it can not receive more money and any additional funds that go to it get spread out automatically evenly over all buckets.

|BNS, AQN, ENB, POW, TD, SU, FTS, CCL.B, ARE, TRI, NWH.UN, MRU, SLF, NTR, QBR, MAL, CSW.A, SGR.UN (more detail on thought below)

I am investing with a likely 7 -10 year time horizon. I am a 29 y/o. I am invested in an unregistered account and Canadian  ETFs / Mutual funds are not an option for me as a us / cad dual citizen (see pfic compliance). 

I built this portfolio about 6 months ago with some additions over the more recent term / topped up some positions. This is intended to be mostly a buy and hold diversified portfolio, though I do monitor it and adjust / add periodically. I am open to closing some positions if there better choices (I closed a position in FCR.UN today and distributed it to BNS, AQN, and SU) 


BNS - 7.85% (I think their international exposure is interesting, and I have many times considered dropping my banking for tangerine)

AQN - 7.81% (profitable "renewables" took an unfair beating from Texas storm so I averaged down)

ENB - 7.8% (pipeline, yeild, invaluable existing infrastructure that will never be replicated)

POW -7.74% - (in company liked their wealth simple ownership nice dividend I did not expect the run its having kinda want to take some gains and distribute but I also still think it's a great company)

TD - 7.29% (who I bank with, anecdotal awesome customer service for their us expansion, and as far as I can tell the best retail investing platform of the big banks minus the fees)

SU - 6.78% (oil stocks were just way too cheap, my favourite from AB don't seem like a scummy company)

FTS- 6.11% (stable stable stable div)

CCL.B- 5.74% (packaging company - benefit from ecommerce and small business, label brand Avery is great imo)

ARE- 5.03% (recovery play - Bahamas airport and infrastructure spending- kicking myself for not picking STN or WSP but that's what happens)

TRI- 4.94%(world leader in information collation, loved their news- not happy it's going in a paywall but  for their stock that's probably a good thing)

NWH.UN - 4.49% (good stable dividend safe portfolio of government backed health assets with no us exposure really, and extremely long lease terms)

MRU - 4.04% (grocery with more specific exposure to Quebec)

SLF - 3.6% (personal great experiences with SLF as a forward thinking innovative benefits provider)

NTR- 3.22% (low cost production fertilizer company think it's a pretty good bet for growth and has been doing so)

QBR - 3.16% (I honestly don't even know anymore)

MAL - 2.94% (partially recovery play for aerospace parts, wanted to support some cool high end manufacturing)

CSW.A - 2.51% (stable liquor company, like alot of their staple brands, steady decent yeild)

SGR.UN - 2.39% (stable grocery anchored REIT with high yeild)

PHO - 1.48% (waiting for sale to finalize was meant to be long term speculative hold)

|I was in your situation when I was 18... what I did was I contributed to my TFSA in a growth mutual fund (I didn't need money and it was 2008/2009 - the market wasn't doing well)  I also did a ongoing biweekly contribution to the same fund over the course of the year when I was in university.  I came out ahead of my friends when I graduated.  As for trading on itrade/Scotia/whatever broker.. just be careful as the risk is always higher buying an individual stock.

|Good point. 

The only thing I would add is that the supply is actually higher than 40k. I don't know by how much, but, there is a supply number directly linked to properties be sold without a purchase to replace it. Be it from retirees selling to fund a their retirement with the intent of renting or moving into a retirement home, estate sales, or people selling to move abroad. Also, not every single one of those immigrants will account for a purchase. 

Even with adjusted supply and demand numbers, your point stands.  I'm just being difficult here. I think that the numbers are likely slightly closer but still leaning towards too much demand, not enough supply, and no way to correct in time without some crazy communist/socialist style influence that likely would not be tolerated.|

My friend also found out she can‚Äôt work on her own house; there is a rule that only US citizens can do repairs or renovations on houses in her area.‚Äù

Often forget how protectionist the US laws are. Kinda crazy really.

I worked with a couple of Americans in Europe in my 20s, I know they dreaded tax season when they lived abroad. This was part of the reason they moved home. Which ultimately is what the US gov wants, more citizens to tax and more consumers to buy things.|

|This is the only gold miner I am interested right now, I perceive a high margin of safety.  A major thing to note when looking at the snapshot of numbers today is that they are buying a large gold reserve in Guyana - the Gold X acquisition.  On the one hand they are buying for extremely cheap, its huge amount of gold, also in a new jurisdiction that diversifies their geographic exposure, and management including Serafino knows the Guyana shield very well so it will be developed well.  Serafino is kindof a legend in the gold mining and oil/gas development space and knows how to get developments done quicker than most that cash flow.

But on the other hand, this acquisition did change the profile of the company.  After the merger, there will be more shares so all the ratios you mention will change (even though still dirt cheap). And although they are drowning in free cash flow right now, the majority of the cash going forward will be to fund the Gold X mine development (right now so much cash is coming in, they are also continuing to pay down debt too and are already net cash).  There were some investors that were more short term oriented and just wanted GCM to be a cash cow and do buybacks, not to move to grow/diversify their mining.  But GCM bought all those ounces of gold at a super low price I personally am ok with it and will hold longer if the market wants to see that mine humming before they give it a stock price in the double digits.

Regarding the valuation of GCM, there's the basics - it's net cash right now, free cash flow per share is super high, all in costs are reasonable/low at around 1100 per ounce, there is likely a long runway still in their cash cow property that is proven, many veins haven't been tapped, they have a track record in Columbia including working with artisinal miners as partners so the jurisdiction and the country likes them.  BUT another bullish valuation factor to consider regarding the valuation is that they have stakes in multiple other mines that alone compose two thirds of their current market cap! (and whose valuations are expected to grow)  The biggest is their 44% stake in Aris Gold, you can look it up in Yahoo and see that it has a market cap of 315 million - so the market is truly not giving GCM any respect for its own operation.  Personally I think there's a good chance after the overhang of the merger is done that the stock resumes an upward trend similar to what it did for 3 years prior to 2021. On the technicals it broke down the main channel so you could wait to see if it turns up first before getting in, though I can still draw a trend line from the covid lows and we are pretty much exactly there right now so I wouldn't be surprised we hit bottom.

Some catalysts as well is they will get results from their drilling in their cash cow Segova mining this year which will supplement their reserves.  They also might make a deal with the Chinese for Gold X to use their infrastructure and speed up the Gold X operation to 18 months or less.   Finally, they are completing a development and by September they are going to start collecting new high margin revenue from their tailings that will add more cash - you can see them talking about it in the last earnings call.  More free cash and improving their ESG reputation further.

Disclosure: I recently added to bump up my holdings to six figures, and may increase my exposure further in the coming weeks.  Gold is a decent uncorrelated asset class although I would not suggest to have it be your top holding.  As with anything, do your own due diligence.|
Now you're prepared.

Yep capital gains tax is a bitch.
There‚Äôs an important word in my post you may have overlooked.
|Others have covered it quite well already but I've found it to be a messy process unless you already have another vested interest in the states or possibly if you're going big with multiple units.  While the rental income to price is more favorable many markets down south are arguably also in a RE bubble.  One of the reasons our RE boom is so much greater this cycle is because everyone understands the interest our government has in protecting that sector, not the case down south should markets nose dive.  Our lack of secondary cities keeps demand pressures in big metros high and a crash is more likely to be a smaller pullback followed by stagnation for a bit.

I personally would strongly consider it AFTER a big market correction AND a strong CAD to justify the hassle for me despite living 20min from the border.  I don't really expect those circumstances to line up though.  If it was simpler or I'd have more capital to go multiple units I'd definitely get in on the Texas boom couple years ago, maybe even switch companies so I'd work in the states exclusively for a while.

Just my personal take.  I'm a pretty cautious person though so maybe it makes more sense for you.|

|Canada is not that important. The US housing market crash was impactful because it was the US.

Oil and gas will be with us for decades.  Coal as well in emerging countries.
Settings and shareholders material
But no one did.
|Hypothetically, whether you have $70,000 or $70 million, what matters is your financial goals. 

Most of us don‚Äôt have more than about 1% of that kind of money, so for about 99% of people the goal is to be able to afford to retire with a similar life to the one pre-retirement. 

So assuming you‚Äôre like most people, in a vacuum, you don‚Äôt need to actually invest that money. You‚Äôre just...rich now. You retire (presumably) early and you enjoy your life, write a will that leaves some of your leftover cash to whoever, and that‚Äôs that! Investing $70 million for someone with a middle class upbringing should be pretty simple - by just letting it accumulate even 1% interest you‚Äôd probably never run out unless you made a series of unfortunate decisions.

Now let‚Äôs say you want to do something with that money - perhaps provide for the family you have, perhaps start some kind of charity or foundation, maybe go into business, whatever - your ambitions should have a plan behind them. As others recommend, you seek professional advice. It just depends what you want to do, that‚Äôll dictate how you choose to allocate.|

More fees piled on?
You are taxed on 50% of your capital gains. Not pay 50%!
At 18 you can only have 6k in tsfa tho
|50% of your gains is taxable at your tax bracket rate.

If your ACB is $10 for 1 share and you sell at $20 your gain is $10. Only half of the gain is taxable so $5 (10 x 50%).

If your marginal tax bracket is 25% then your tax owing is $1.25 ($5 x 25%)|
|That‚Äôs the point of getting a lawyer as the first step. Usually there‚Äôs loopholes you can use to avoid giving your name. Like setting up a trust fund or company as the entity which wins the money and you remain the anonymous recipient.

|Ok, but if I sell my home, have 500k in that bank and spend that on a boat or vacation, isn't that purchase included in stats that are not homes? How I think it works is when I hear 10% of GDP is homes, what that really means is that some portion of that 10% (probably the majority) is simply counting the appreciation of all home values, whether they are sold or not?|

|Depends on what your goals are really. Do you want to own a yacht and live rich or keep living more or less the same way you do now? Something in between? Do you want to collect Ferraris and vacation houses around the globe? You would have a lot of options.

|Combine that with:

- boomer generation: large demographic. long life expectancy, tend to stay in homes until death

occurring at the same time as

- millennial generation: a very large demographic as they are kids of the boomers. a demographic which have moved into home buying age in recent years.

So on the domestic front you have a large group of people staying in their homes, while a large group of people are looking to buy homes.|

|Agreed mostly. from my other post

130k coming into GTA each year from abroad. Add in current Canadians who are looking to buy homes in the GTA. That is your 'demand'.

40k houses built annually. That is your supply.

Completely unsustainable. Not even in the ballpark of being reasonable. Simple numbers, simple facts.

You can put in the most restrictive policies possible, but eventually the numbers above will catch up and history will repeat itself. Way more people than houses will invariably lead to higher prices, anything else is a temporary measure.|

|If you want to keep saving monkey, don't buy a car if you can use public transit. It's a trade off between money and convenience and for me it was bloody well worth it.

No need to pay for gas, parking, insurance, maintenance, or tickets of any kind. In the winter, if you have a good transit system, your mode of transport is pre-warmed and you might only have a short wait outside. It's not for everyone though.

Another bit you can possibly do: If you get student loans, they typically don't accrue interest while you're enrolled, and you don't have to re-pay them until after you graduate/are out of school. If you have money left over from those loans (lets say you get a bunch of scholarships), put the loan money into an investment account. You will make money on it while not accumulating interest during your degree. At the end of your degree, liquidate the account, put a lump sum payment on your loan for the original amount you had and pocket the profit.

|I‚Äôve never heard of the price of the house making it easier for you to get a loan. 

Yes the loan is secured against your property, but that doesn‚Äôt impact the lending rules the government put in place that lenders must follow.

It actually gets more difficult to buy more expensive homes as you require larger down payments and default insurance is higher after certain thresholds. Plus interest scales up as a percentage so you will have to pass a significantly higher stress test.|

|I mean, I can't tell what metrics you're using but I have a feeling when you speak of family wealth you're talking about the wealth of individual family units (a couple/ individual and their kids).

In that case you're probably accurate, but what I'm mostly referring to here is the wealth shifting from historically wealthier boomer parents who pass away to what is also a historically smaller set of children. Boomers were born in an era where you had an average of 3.5-4 children per family unit, boomers went on to have around \~2 children per family unit. So, when boomers start to pass away in large numbers, their wealth will be split between fewer children than in previous generations.

Anecdotally, I have a fairly middle class upbringing and almost any boomer relative I have has made out pretty nicely riding the real estate wave, while many of my friends and younger relatives are still priced out. I 'd wager this isn't an unusual state of affairs throughout Canada.

So, assuming boomers don't also blow their accumulated wealth before passing, many millennial Canadians will suddenly come into large amounts of money all around the same time when their parents start passing since their parent's wealth will only be split \~1-3 ways, where it had previously been split \~3-5.

In short, millennials will be inheriting a greater proportion of their parents wealth than previous generations. So what I'm interested in is this -- what happens when a significant amount of Canadians all find themselves with the ability to afford many of the larger purchases they had previously been priced out of all around the same time?|
That does not sound like something that will work.

|u/Material_Piccolo_637 \- If you favor index investing over stock picking, I suggest you read The Four Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein. He outlines a strategy of asset allocation and rebalancing with dollar cost averaging used as a means to an end; i.e. how to get your initial cash into your desired allocations. 

Under Bernstein's strategy, once your money is allocated properly future investments are relatively easy regardless of market fluctuations. You always try to buy enough to bring your dips back in line with your allocation targets and you always sell off investments that exceed your targets.|
I was in a similar situation a while back and the option I took was to open a TFSA with questrade since buying Canadian ETFs are free and a friend of mine had a referral code that gave me 50 for depositing 10k. If u want a referral code just PM me. I then proceeded to put a bunch into equity ETFs like VFV(Holds S&amp;P 500) XEQT (iShares core equity). You should do your own research into what you want to invest in but if you don't know where Canadian Couch Potato model portfolios might be a good place to start for ETFs. The rest I hold in my account for casual trading.
|Somewhat self-serving, but I recently had Ben Rabidoux on my podcast to specifically talk about how Canadian real estate was able to not only side-step the worst economic shock in Canadian history, it accelerated.

\-those who were, tended to see their financial situations improve during the pandemic  
\-government supports were 3x the labour income losses  
\-lower interest rates have further increased debt servicing ability  
\-population dynamics negatively affected the rental market more than the resale market  
\-changing consumer preferences  
\-you would have made more just owning an average home than working a six-figure job

|Right, so you're probably not in Toronto,  and had a decent down payment so the mortgage is less than that, plus the security of two incomes.

The only condos in Toronto that are $450K right now are tiny studios in out-of-the-way places with a non-existent walk score, and older buildings with higher maintenance fees.  I would have had to put $150K down on a $600K place with (barely) enough space to live and work from home in a walkable area.  

TD's mortgage calculator tells me that just the mortgage payment alone would be $1936/month.  Tack on $500 in fees and what, $180 in property tax and I'd be pushing $2600 a month before buying a single piece of food or paying any other bills.  Too tight.|
|"Lump sum will usually beat dca about 2/3 of the time"

This is an interesting statement. Lump sum vs. DCA paying off is a function of timing. Lump sum works great when you are able to get in on the dip or you get in on a "perpetual" upward swing. DCA works great when there is a lot of volatility and you are not sure if you are on a dip or a spike, or if the market is going to trend down.

The statement about lump sum beating DCA 2/3 of the time is interesting because the stock market, in general, has always risen over a long investment horizon. So getting your money in lump-sum and letting it grow over the long term, regardless of where the market is today, might get you better results if your DCA timing is not correct.

On the other hand, if you lump sum just before a downturn, even though over the long term you will still experience gains, you may be leaving money on the table. By hedging with DCA, if the market drops but you buy in in chunks, when it eventually recovers you will technically be better off because you were able to buy more shares for the same amount of money.

To me, DCA makes sense when you have a large amount to invest and the market is volatile or otherwise dropping over the short/medium term. Investing during a recession might be a good time to apply DCA. Lump sum makes sense if the market seems relatively strong or if you don't think you can time it (which should be most of the time).|

If you make 200k a year, you can afford these prices easily. Borrowing is dirt cheat right now.

|You may be forced to buy a bus pass regardless of your car. Check with your university. If you will have to buy a bus pass, maybe avoid buying a car entirely. You could save thousands on gas, insurance, maintainence, and especially parking at a uni.

If you don't need the car, great! If you don't need that money for tuition, textbooks, etc., then invest in TFSA. I would reccomend that you get a self-directed TFSA account with your local bank. Make sure to shop arround to get the lowest commission, and online investing is very handy.|

|Here‚Äôs a tip buy otc shares in your US account and sell in your US account this way you skip all the fees, and then ask TD to transfer the monies to you CDN account and you make an extra 20% will this work?|
|We looked at this several years ago, couldn't quite close a deal. The prices and returns can be quite a bit better than anything we saw in Canada. A couple of tips :

1. Unless you have a Green Card, you can't "work" in the States, so you'll need a local reno crew (rather than doing it yourself).
2. Given distance, you'll want a local management company, so remember to budget for it (6-10% of gross rent).
3. Understand the state you are investing in. Some have very tenant friendly laws. Some have very tight closing times (Chicago : 2 days). Since states you close through a lawyer, others through a title company. Texas has very high property taxes (can be $1,000/mo!) Etc.
4. You need a plan for taxes and related corporate structure. Owning American things personally directly provides no liability protection, makes you have to deal with US withholding, and potentially exposes you to US estate taxes. You can do things like *property -&gt; American Co -&gt; Canada Co -&gt; you *, but then you have to maintain those companies ($$).
5. You'll probably want to buy a "commercial" property, i.e. 5+ units. Unless you already have American-source income, you'll have basically no ability to get a residential mortgage. With a commercial property and the right bank, they'll look to the property itself (rather than your non-existent American income) to carry the loan. You'll still need 25+% siren payment.

Good luck!|
|I wonder about the usefulness of P/E and P/B as a relates to gold miners.  I would suspect that the earnings and book value are closely tied to the commodity prices and can fluctuate, and I also wonder what the book value is based on (reserves?  property, plant, equipment?  etc.)

|I have an investment property in Florida. It was hard to get it going but once you have a good property manager, then it‚Äôs smooth sailing. The rental yield is much better in America. I bought an inventory home so there was little to no maintenance needed. Community fees were pretty standard around 250 but slowly increasing. What I did was I refinanced my house to buy the home outright. In terms of taxes, I own 25% of it with each member of my family so the taxes are much lower.|
|Depends on how dedicated you will be to investing/stock trading, as well as your timeline and risk tolerance. And of course your objective for the money. 

Assuming you're 18, living at home with parents, minimal bills, and a long term time horizon (5+ years), I would go aggressive index funds with a few value picks and some growth picks. 

Example: 

Nasdaq/US equities index fund: 25-35%

VEQT/XEQT: 30%

MSFT/AMZN/GOOG/NVDA/FB/NFLX: 20%

PLTR/BB/JMIA/NIO/TESLA: 10-20%

That's just an example, I'd mix it up depending on your personal preference. This also requires some maintenance and rebalancing of the portfolio at least annually to ensure you're on track.

Personally, if you're not going to take this seriously you could legitimately just buy a S&amp;P 500 index fund, make regular purchases and let it ride for 30 years. You'd probably beat 85-90% of stock traders that way.|
We bought pre-COVID at $450k at household income of $125k  and that‚Äôs enough for me haha
Lump sum will usually beat dca about 2/3 of the time. Dca will usually perform a bit worse due to price fluctuations and fees. Where dca shines is if the market is going down as you can bring your avg cost down. In times of crashes and corrections people will usually dca down as it is impossible to time the market.

DCA is a reasonable strategy for someone saving for retirement who doesn‚Äôt want to spend time and effort on stock picking or market timing.
|Hey so I want to share this with you as it's really important and will change how you think.

I buy 10 shares of bb on Tuesday for 10 dollars a share.

The next week I buy 10 shares for 20 dollars.

I now own 20 shares of bb and the cost is 11 dollars a share after the pump and dump happened.

Did I make money?

Answer = no.

I now have 20 shares worth 15 dollars a share due to dollar cost averaging. Aka lost 4 dollars a share = big losses.

I have a big spread of stocks for "diversification". The big D word these meme stock boys don't care to understand.

When 8 are green and 2 are red I put my money into the red stocks so I can average down and make more money when the stock rebounds.

It gives me direction. The hardest part is when all your stocks are green as fuck and now you gotta decided which one you put money into. Sure you get more stock but you DCA'd up and now the total of your stock is technically worth less.

Following me?

Now if you dump everything into a safe ETF every month or bi monthly and the bull market continues you are DCA up no matter what. That's life but if the market keeps rising who cares. When it crashes we all just treat it like "sales" and buy more to DCA down.

If your in stocks for a month your in the wrong game.

If you gamble on AMC and gme then that's on you and these investing terms don't mean anything to you nor should they your gambling not investing.

Hope this helps! And if my math is wrong on the stock value sorry but you get the point I hope|

This only impacts you if you'd ever consider going to live in the States but if they get back to "normalcy" it's much more affordable there if you can stand the crazies.|

Any additional amount, you can keep as part of a ‚Äúcash account‚Äù and hold those investments more long terms &amp; if you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúday trading‚Äù you gains will be taxed as capital gains. 

You are also going to be getting student Loans (assuming it‚Äôs from the government) it‚Äôs interest free &amp; also comes with grants so don‚Äôt forget about those.

For investments I would focus on some solid  ETFs, and maybe some portion on high conviction growth stocks for long term. 

Have maybe  5-10% as cash (after all your expenses are paid/prepaid) for the year as an emergency fund or pre approved LOCs (only pay interest as you use) 

And if possible try to find a part time job ideally with a commission aspect. 

I personally use TD, the ‚Äúfree‚Äù ones aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúfree‚Äù and I find less reliable but to each their own 

Good luck!|

|There are way too much macro risks with EMs...specially Countries like India and Brazil. The access to vaccines will turn this recovery into a K-shape. The DM countries will make sure that their people get fully vaccinated before anyone else. So they wil get back on recovery paths sooner while EM economies will undergo this on again off again situation depends on the spread of COVIDs. Most EM countries are not in a good fiscal shapes, and couldn't afford running stimulus programs like the US and Canada without massively depreciate their currencies (think Turkey). Then, as the DM countries recover, they will look to normalize their interest rates. The money will flow out of EM back to DM, cancel out some of the positive fundamentals in EM (weaker currency, better export, etc.). Depends how fast the rates are going up in DM, they may force EM to raise interest rates at a time when their economies are just recovering, and hurting that in the process.

Vietnam is financially good shape, so VNM is fine. But I will look into the Brazil and India macro more closely. If one is looking for a Canada style recovery play, UK may be of interest. The brexit drama is close to the end, and the country has the highest vaccinated %. And their political and financial systems are more stable. As they are closing to re-open the economy, we should see growth from the country. The index itself is home to many banks and big energy names. Although it has recovered somewhat this year, the negative press in recent years seem to still keep the country's valuation low. 

But to OPs question... Essentially we are looking for  active managers who focus on emerging tech companies in EM. That's some venture capital level stuff, and there is a huge demand among high net worth people / accredited investors and they are willing to pay active fees for the said strategies. If you don't want that, maybe overlay some individual names over the board EM market index. Some of them are traded on the US exchange already or some  have quite a bit of liquidity on the OTC pink sheet, like Tencent (TCEHY). Some institutional researches once argued you can view the company as a media tech venture capital fund.|
|Assuming that you do not need the cash for university, I would spend 6 - 8 k on a used car and invest the remainder in a TFSA. Like others have said, reserve your RRSP room till you have graduated and are at a higher income level.

Since you are just starting out I would advise against picking individual stocks. Keep it simple and invest in XEQT or VEQT.  You have a tremendous time advantage. Assuming average returns $15k invested for 40 years can turn into $300k or more.

Don't be tempted by FOMO and get rich quick schemes. It's just as likely that you will lose money and squander your advantage.|
Sarcastic
|Nice! Well you could instantly max your TFSA and invest with those funds. There is tuition to consider as well. 

Probably not worth starting on the RRSP quite yet as you'll likely want to use some of the remaining funds in the next few years. Also will want to keep a buffer of several months for living expenses (car insurance, gas, cellphone, etc.) and annual car maintenance items.|
|Oh I‚Äôve sent that button but I was always scared I‚Äôd mess something up LOL. 
Especially with tfsa contributions, rrsp limits, etc etc so I just found it‚Äôs less stressful to have someone else do it who knows what they doing . But good point, will look into it more.|
ok thanks a lot
Yes. I would focus on maximizing TFSA.
|There‚Äôs a transfer button on the web broker, no need to contact a TD Rep|
ok thank you! so you suggest i put more in my tfsa to start off
|Ya the annoying part is when something is going up really quick it‚Äôs tough and stressful to do the math on exactly how much I should put in and then I don‚Äôt want to go into a negative balance either loool 
I know some platforms you can put how much you want to buy ($ worth) and I think it executes accordingly.|
|They are both considered tax advantaged. 

For TFSA you are taxed on the money before you put it in, but not when you withdraw.

For RRSP you don't pay tax on the money when you put it in, but you do when you take it out.  (Which in theory you do when you retire and your income is much less than at the peak of your career  so you pay less in tax than when you were working)

Regular accounts your income is taxed and then again when you sell and recognize a capital gain.|
[removed]
|As far as I know there is no way to do that without a market buy or if your platform supports fractional shares.

If you do a limit buy and bet a little above the market price, it will instantly buy at market price the amount of shares you asked to. (If there is float and whatever) by putting a limit buy you are grantees that it won't go over your price 

If the stock is around 24.90$ you make a limit buy of 24.95$ for 400 shares. The trade will most likely go through instantly and you will have paid at most 9980$|
Thanks I didn't know this!
|When you go to buy US real estate, the agents don't tell you this stuff. You have to pay a lawyer and an accountant (who specializes in this) to tell you the ramifications of buying there:

1) Rental Income: Taxes on foreign owned investment property. 

2) When you sell: "If a Canadian resident sells real estate located in the United States, they are subject to a 10% or 15% withholding tax of the gross selling price under FIRPTA (Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act). ... The gain on the sale is still taxable in the U.S. and a tax return (1040NR) must be filed. (from Aug. 14, 2020)".|
|Sorry guys, Mentioned it to a bunch of people who have traded for a long time &amp; they weren‚Äôt aware &amp; it was very helpful for them. New to the forums so I just thought I‚Äôd post something people may find helpful :)
Glad a lot of people are aware about it 
Cheers|
thank you i appreciate your input and you are right i think i will utilize a tfsa more so obviously due to the tax free features
It‚Äôs not influential until the dominoes fall on each other. The world is so connected. Like the butterfly effect?
|oh ya i should of clarified, i am looking at a used tacoma and won‚Äôt be financing i‚Äôm gonna buy it with cash and i think i will get some help from family. i‚Äôm pretty lucky that way|
makes sense! thank you for your input
went all in on $BB and my balance is now -2k
It has been on par and even worth more a few times.  They will try and keep it lower and they will succeed but the timing isn‚Äôt perfect.  It may hit par before the government gets their way.
|Ah I see, makes sense. Yeah I kind of thought they were basically the same. Thanks for the clarification!

And thanks for that video, it seems like an excellent resource. Can't wait to watch it!|
|I would consider passing on contributing to an RRSP now and save contribution room for when you are at a higher salary. Additionaly, if you needed to access cash, you would pay taxes on it when you withdraw.

Generally, unless someone has a very high salary, they are better off maximizing TFSAs before RRSPs.

I would also look at opening a WS TFSA and use it to hold CAD securities that way you get free trades without the CAD/USD conversion rates. Then use your banks trading platform for USD securities and see if they have DRIP for companies that offer dividends.

When you are choosing what to buy think about risk vs when you will want to access the funds. If you don't plan on needing it in the short term than your investments can have higher risks, but if you think you may need to use the money during your studies, look at blue chip investments or low risk ETFs (can also keep cash an emergency fund)

Good on you for being so financially minded so early. You are setting yourself up for long term success.|
|Yes, it creates a situation where millenials or gen x are waiting for their parents to die, to afford housing. Also, at best it just passes the baton from "haves" to their children, people on lower rungs of wealth will be excluded|
It takes a long time to move money around with free WS and I've seen stuff like this too.
Lol see that's why all this is fucked. Middle class shouldn't have a rental property equal or greater to the value of their principal residence.
[deleted]
What car were you thinking? Used or New? It may be better to use your savings and pay your entire car off instead of financing depending what you're looking at/what rates are available.
Keep like 5k / 6 months worth of expenses in cash and invest the rest. Buy an index fund like VFV in wealthsimple TFSA and dollar cost average into it so you don‚Äôt buy all in at the top if the market crashes soon.
|Effectively the same. I was starting off so I chose XEQT for the slightly lower MER but long term they will probably have the same if not very similar returns.

https://youtu.be/jehooxCWU1k|
|They always take this into account, without this nobody in the middle class would own rental properties|
Why? I've been renting and investing quite successfully.
|Its money laundering.  Internationally Canada is a safe haven for, what criminal organizations call, "snow washing".

https://endsnowwashing.ca/what-is-snowwashing#:~:text=Snow-washing%20is%20a%20type,is%20now%20being%20used%20internationally.

Snow washing in BC, with what they've been able to trace, has raised prices 5%, based only on what they could catch.

As well FOMO, an influx of money leaving destabilized economic zones, and realtors using unethical sales tactics like "shadow flipping".  It's been all over the news for years, the government is banking on the housing market keeping our GDP up.

That being said, it's fucking up the house Price-To-Rent Ratio, rent is now reflecting million dollar mortgages (if there is a mortgage).

This is the way
When the US real estate drops that is when the CDN dollar will be at par with the US dollar sorry but just like before it will happen again.
Or you can do it the wallstreebets way and use Blackberry to do your Norbert gambit and be down 53% but save those sweet 2.5% conversion fees.
|I went with a LOC, but I'm paying kind of high interest, 5.67%, on it. However, at the time I bought in, last summer, the dividend income was more than sufficient for me to break even on interest costs vs. Dividend income. Someone posted on this a week ago and it sounds like one of the smaller banks is offering investment loans that have a better rate. I think 3.45%?|
What's your opinion on XEQT vs VEQT? Why do you prefer XEQT? I'm looking to invest in one of these
strictly to bring down my taxable income (&gt;150k)
|Unfortunately I believe prices won‚Äôt drop. If the bidding wars stop, we can level growth and shave off 10% from these driven up prices.

If you have an opportunity to buy, I would take a look at entering the market|
|well when i saw 40 hours a week that‚Äôs during the summer, and 30 hours was this year in grade 12 doing online school|
|I definitely agree GTA and southern Ontario and parts of southern BC are shit show territory, other areas like Edmonton and Calgary are still reasonably-ish priced for large cities.  Suburban Montreal is still not crazy either.  
Assuming you‚Äôre wanting to stay in a large city.|
What program are you doing where you can work 40 hrs a week ?
[deleted]
|Honestly; saved it too. I'm really intimidated/confused though, there's so many potential good options|
|It is messy. It may be mitigated by setting up a holding company, but I'm not sure. I'd talk to a professional about it.|
|Yes exactly, and which government controls this? No government has total control over their currency‚Äôs value, for starters all currency markets involve multiple governments.|
|WS often has glitches with balances. Give it 24 hours for it to balance and correct itself. It should all be normal by then. If not, then contact them but I see mine go minus sometimes when I deposit funds.|
|Same issue, at -24$|
Can you explain this further? Isn't the $9.99 commission strictly worse than the $5 mentioned at Questrade? Or is this a sarcastic answer?
I have not seen my cabin in the US in almost 1.5 years due to a pandemic I didn‚Äôt think would ever happen. Make sure you have all of your ducks in a row.
Have you stepped out of north America ever?
Great info thanks . Taxation seems messy
|You have to report capital gains/losses on foreign exchange above $200 CAD for the year.

USD margin on IBKR also has an ever so slightly lower interest rate at the moment.|
You obviously haven‚Äôt spoken to many companies. I have and they said they will be having a hybrid work environment post pandemic. I have also been promoted remotely by doing my regular work efficiently and nothing has changed from what I was able to do in the office
It went to par before..  why wasn't that prevented?
|There was a par dollar a couple times over the past 20 years . Property management fees in the US would be similar if you live in Toronto and purchase a property in Calgary,  from my research it is on month of rent. Lending and taxes may be an issue.  But if dollar is over 90 cents seems like a great oppurtunity as there are so many options to snag a deal  in the US Sun belt.|
This is Norbert's Gambit. Pretty well known
|This is norberts gambit , and usually recommended if you can do ETF to minimize market fluctuations|
|Ok but the person I was replying to wasn‚Äôt so, again, this is broker dependent lol.|

|First, "the rising cdn dollar especially if it reaches par." will NEVER happen. It makes everything we export too expensive, the government will absolutely prevent that from happening.

Second, buying investment properties might look good on paper, but you will have tax complications and property management costs (who's going to fix and maintain the property). If this is not for you, look for some REITs (or US REIT equivalent) instead.|
|Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been lurking for a while now but curious to know where I can improve on my portfolio.

30 years old, investment horizon is long term (20-30 years). Currently working on a TFSA and building that up by adding $500 a month. Below is my current portfolio appreciate any tips or advice. 

AC-5.3% (plan is to exit when it reaches $40 mark or so, it is my only short-medium term hold)

ENB-4.6%

FTS-16.2%

HEO- 5.7%

L- 7.4%

NPI- 4%

T- 13.1%

TD- 27.5%

VRE- 6.1%

VXC- 10.3%


Long term I have mapped how I want my portfolio to be distributed which is below and how I am working on molding it:

Oil and Gas- 5%
Utilities- 10%
Renewables- 10%
Consumer Goods- 5%
Telecom- 10%
Financial- 15%
REIT- 10%
International ETF- 20%
Tech- 5%
Materials/Mining- 5%
Healthcare- 5%

The three last areas (materials, tech, healthcare) I have not added to yet but would appreciate thoughts on. For materials/mining I was looking at XGD since it lowers the volatility of an individual gold miner. Healthcare I was thinking of adding WELL if it dips when I have cash on hand in the future (this would be one of my two major ‚Äúgrowth/higher risk‚Äù stocks which also includes HEO), and finally for the 5% tech I was debating about XIT vs. TECH since I do want exposure to good Canadian tech like shopify and CSU but the mer is fairly high in XIT for fewer holdings and Canadian tech is not the powerhouse of the US. However many of the big US tech companies in TECH are covered within VXC already. 

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!|
Sketchy shit show

Credit cards aren't accepted in places where you could only pay cash and I doubt someone would refuse a cash payment in USD (maybe he'll ask for a premium and it'll be off the books though).
|I agree, no reason to sweat. Throughout the past 10 years there have been these leaps and lulls with crypto, sometimes swinging 50-80%.   I kinda wish they would release their earnings report though|
I was speaking on Questrade
|Let me guess those shares were from AMC profits. I posted on wealthsimple trade but mods deleted my post and idk why. Lot of people have this issue. I think they might be updating or something. 


I sold my shares on Wednesday and I checked now they restored my shares as if I never sold them. So weird|
|I don't think Apple is a bubble, but I think the Tesla growth and P/E ratio is factored into much that it will take a decade for business to catch up the stock price.|
|I believe they are one of the best plays, both for long term investment and swing trading.  But anything can and will happen in this sector.  Lots of M&amp;A activity in both US and Canada.

It's run up a bit over the past month again, but any entry below 20 CDN I feel is a good place to start a position.|
He's talking about profiting on cannabis stocks
House prices are rising because real estate agents are telling people to buy? Agents are more or less always saying that. And no one is getting a million dollar mortgage making 50k
There's a USD etf FM.
|Everyone talk about supply and demand but at the end of the day no one works where these small towns are seeing some crazy increases. 

People say the only way is to provide more supply to the market, but seriously.. take a look around. Everyone is looking for a house, not a highrise condo unit.

So developers build where there's no jobs and people buy and are left holding the bag??? We need more sustainable development to provide smaller communities instead of every suburb and rural area relying on Toronto income.|
|Yeah, different experiences. I'm sure there are good and bad advisors, just like everything. It's important to have a good match between you and your advisor, and a good advisor should be able to adapt to the client's style. I certainly agree with you about compensation; it should be more transparent.|
|I was doing this a very long time ago, when I had first moved to Canada and didn't even qualify for a credit card here and my RSP contribution limit was zero. Nowadays I can cover an emergency trip abroad with credit cards if need be (which if you pay within the billing cycle is also interest free).

Good advice about the HELOC, but I don't own real estate anymore -- I sold it off to lock in my gains and then put the proceeds in the stock market, which has done well meanwhile.

Anyway, my point is, situations are different, and it's actually common to see people with very large amounts just sitting in chequing, and it's not because they are "ballers" or something. It's extremely common if you look outside North America where consumer credit is for the most part not a thing and stock markets are far less accessible to individuals, and people do carry those habits with them.|
What you're missing is the crooked mortgage brokers that falsify information
|Yeah nobody is getting a 1M mortgage on 50k a year without a substantial down-payment or leveraged equity in some other assets. Not happening, if it has happened in Canada recently that would be a very rare case. 

Without leverage the federal stress testing is actually very stringent. I would argue people that make 200k a year are struggling to buy homes at this point. 

First time home buyers on middle class wages are fucked, but hey if you can lock in these interest rates and have a pile of cash sitting around real estate is probably one of the smartest things to invest in. Better than buying imaginary money.|
Have you had a lot of experience predicting catalysts on undervalued names?
|A quick check, it looks like the balance missing is the profit I made from selling some AMC. And the AMC shares are still in my account. Odd|
[deleted]
|If that suits your needs, then fine. There are pros and cons to buying ETFs, just as there are pros and cons to buying shares in particular companies. Easy? Yes, for sure. Safe and good returns? For now. But don't forget that stock markets can go down, too. NASDAC lost over 30% last spring. It only recovered quickly because of unprecedented government intervention; three years to recover is more typical. It depends on the time scale for your investment and on your risk tolerance.|
|Little boy is right, their post history is a cringe festival. Fake screenshot of massive dividends payouts lmao|
|I get the convenience thing, it's the only reason I'm using them for my rrsp.

The biggest thing for me is the delay in what I have and what it's worth. If I sell something, it doesn't always immediately reflect on my buying power, it usually comes through later in the day or the following - this isn't related to clearing, it's just their platform. When I am looking at the value of stocks I want to buy or sell, it's a little delayed and I have to use something else to know what the current values are at.

One thing that has perturbed me recently is that I hold some long term options for an underlying that split recently. I now have to call them to liquidate the position. 

Overall, if I have to look at another platform to see what is going on with stocks I want to buy/sell, I should just use that platform. Even yahoo finance is more up-to-date.

The only good thing I can say about their platform is it's convenient and the fees are decent but I don't use it for anything that I may only hold for a couple days or a week. 

Buy and hold - great.

Timing market conditions - poor.|
|Well my experience with wealth management was a bit different. I first meet them to exercise some options. Then I got pass off to another advisor. He was great, I paid 1% of portfolio. However he moved on to another job. I pass along to another financial advisor who was very risk adverse. Then another. My portfolio is seven figures. If the second guy stayed I would still be with them. No I pay 10 a trade, and manage my portfolio with google finance and a spreadsheet. 
I am glad that things worked out for you. However, I believe there should be strict rules regarding financial compensation documentation. People should review their fees to see if there is value for money paid.|
I doubt it will be noticeable. It‚Äôs not like they are all going to die on the same day. The transition will occur over a 20 year period.
Currently looking at -$45 in my TFSA instead of the $500 I had in there. Dandy. Sending an email.
Sold what lol? Cocaine?
|Credit cards still need to pay in a currency. 

So when you pay off your credit card bill you still pay in CAD or USD or whatever currency you use.|
|Its a bad time to buy. If you look at the sales figures the current 'boom' is merely making up for the lack of sales during the pandemic. If you take the sales in May, 21 and those in May, 20 and average them they look almost identical to those in May, 19 before the pandemic.

The point is that its not a boom in sales, its an overcorrection from the lack of sales last year. Which means that the market is very unbalanced with far more buyers than sellers. This will smooth itself out over the next year and prices will moderate. 

The 'hype' is the perpetual overheated voices of realtors who have spent a year living on PB and J sandwiches who want everyone to believe if they dont buy now they'll never get a home. It works in their favor and the sellers like it too. The buyers are the ones panicking and thus getting screwed.

MOST of Canada is still quite reasonable. Greater GTA and GVA are a shit show and should be avoided at all costs.|
Inflation fears are hurting disruptive tech in addition to rotation into other sectors. Long term should be ok but for now do not expect massive returns like 2020 .
M2c. I don‚Äôt remember a time when houses were cheap? I‚Äôd argue they are cheaper then ever with mortgages at 2%. My first house was 115k (and that was on the shitty part of town but it was all I could afford) I was making like $200/week. and my mortgage rate was 6%ish. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for months worried I made a huge mistake. It‚Äôs all relative. Back then minimum wage was $6/hish today min wage is $15 and that house is worth $280k. Do the math it‚Äôs all the same amounts. Buy within your means take your time looking and don‚Äôt get suckered into a bidding war. Houses come up for sale everyday. Don‚Äôt listen to the media
|My theory is, for the most part jobs will be safe. But if you quit or try to find better, that's where you get screwed. If you HODL your job you may be okay. But finding new work, you'll be screwed.

(and yes, obvs your job can quit you)|
|You're missing two very important factors. 

One is that it doesn't matter what your income is to an extent. Maybe you were earning 70k ten years ago and now you climbed to 80k. But, that 350k house you bought at the start of your career has jumped to close to 1m. You decide to sell and buy another house with say 800k down. Maybe you max yourself out again and have a 1.2m purchase. You can afford the 400k mortgage because you earn 80k, and who cares if the place is paid off by retirement, you're banking on continued price increases and determined this new asset will appreciate at a greater rate than the old one. You plan to sell and cash in the equity before moving further away to retire. This is a common scenario which is driving prices. 

The other is that localized incomes don't matter anymore. People won't like this, but it's true. Go to Brampton, or any newer subdivision with big houses and a high density of immigrants. There are extended families living with each other. This is very common. They will all have jobs and contribute together to buy a house, then pay it off together, before going in to buy a second and a third etc etc. This has been a thing for quite some time and these families have amassed quite a bit of wealth by now. The other point here is that a person may on paper only make 65k a year, but in practice, they have a wealthy family who supports them in their country of origin.

For example my neighbor just recently bought their house for more than they can afford based on what I know of their respective fields. One is a student, wife is working in a job that pays less than I earn. They have since completely gutted the house, upgraded the electrical and plumbing, installed acoustic sound boards on every surface, and will soon be drywalling. They are both from Europe and have wealthy family who are funding all of this. Why? The parents really like Canada and are having the kids build a studio apartment so they can come here for extended periods and will likely realize a good return on their initial investment.|
Great one. Im buying on Monday
They tried doing that in the 2000s and the results were so crappy that most of the jobs came back to the original countries. Call centres are the main exception.
|I'll try to explain this by telling you about my experience. I work with a financial advisor from a big Canadian "wealth management" company. When I first met him I was a student and far from being wealthy. We had a long conversation about my financial goals, long and short term needs, risk tolerance, and so on. He made me an actual plan, which was updated regularly. We meet twice a year to review my holdings and my financial situation. I've been working with the same guy for close to 25 years and we know each other very well. Yes, he sells me mutual funds, and he is paid a (small) percentage of the amount he is managing for me. (His fees are part of the mutual funds' management fee. I've never directly given him a penny.) When I started to do some of my own investing, he encouraged me, even though he makes no money when I don't buy through him, and gave me plenty of sound advice. The advice I've got from him over the years has been worth way more than what I have (indirectly) paid him. Plus, the funds he has managed for me, which include a large chunk of my retirement funds, have enjoyed a very strong return over the years. 

My experience with financial advisors at my bank has been quite different. If I tell them I have $X to invest, they pull out some prettily designed pieces of paper and ask if I'd like option A, B, or C. Very little attempt to determine my goals or needs, or how this particular investment fits into my overall financial picture. They just want their commission, and don't really care about me.

Of course I am generalizing, and there are probably some very good advisors working at banks. But it should be clear that you want the former type of advisor, not the latter.|
You might be lost little boy
|I'm not denying that. In fact I say so in my comment. But that mortgage payment is still $4,300 isn't it? So how has it made houses more affordable? If you could afford a $4,300 mortgage payment, you could before and after. Other than saving for the downpayment, it doesn't make houses more attainable for new buyers.|
|Not sure if you suck at math, at reading or both.|
|But is that locally accurate in Canada's case or globally applied? I don't think we can count those living in extreme poverty or third world countries in this situation, with high mortality rates and poor access to healthcare/medicine, sure people will have as many kids as they can support to ensure survival of the family. 

Also when I say comfortable, I mostly mean financially, not so much specifically standard of living, because historically that has only gone up in places as we have new tech to allow more luxurious lifestyles.|
|Just a note, not sure if it‚Äôs mentioned but you can also pull $ out of give RRSP if you have one for the lifelong learning credit tax free|
|Totally get it, for me, I keep aside some high conviction plays &amp; plan to hold them forever unless there is a material change. For me that is Docebo. Then I have my other ones which I am okay with moving around a little bit, but out of the DD I do, I try to find companies with the Shopify factor - high recurring rev, market leaders/disrupters, large market application but also tailored for niches. 
But yes the easiest thing is buying and forgetting with ETFs. I averaged a 250% ROI last year, so I feel I can beat the market with my knowledge &amp; resources. I still focus on LT holds for all my investments|
Can you elaborate why you think it‚Äôs a bad platform?   I bank with them so it was a convenience thing.
Maybe if you want to have extra toilet paper laying aroundü§î
|Let's say I bought a new build for 300k 10 years ago. Now it's worth 1mil. Well, I have a few options. 

One would be to sell it and move far away to retire. Maybe I walk with a decent house paid in cash plus 500k left over. Perfect. My retirement is settled now. 

Another would be to use that money for big purchases which I wouldn't otherwise make. This is one people on here likely won't relate to because they are probably a bit better with their money. But talk to older guys and you'll find out how common it is. That neighbor of yours with a new truck, new boat, who goes on vacation and lives a good life? Ya he probably has borrowed against his house to afford much of that.|

|It's fairly disgusting as a buyer, so in the market to buy.  As of now I secured a rental and waiting instead of buying houses I'm only meh about.   The biggest turn off in buying right now are conditions.

  "All offers shall be presented June 7th by 1:00pm and remain open until 10pm".
Me being who I am, if I do put an offer in by their requested day,  and if I do get called back by my realtor relaying their message something like "you have a very strong offer, but so are others can you do better?" I'm not sure if I can with a open offer on the table but I'll sooner counter offer 10k less to throw blind bidding back in their face.


*note there was a buyer in Toronto receiving similar messages when they put in an offer, they were positive they were losing the purchase from relayed messages, and could not increase their mortgage as they were 100% maxed.  Their offer was accepted, WHO WERE THEY BIDDING VS?!!? Themselves. .|

|Stunting?  What happens when their company discovers they can hire folks from Estonia at 1/2 the price, or Asia for 1/3 of the price.  Remote is remote right?

It's not overly expensive to have a regional legal firm setup a satellite office (Company X Estonia or whatever) and pay the local workforce in local currency, withhold tax etc.  Oh and most Europeans don't require medical or dental, score! 

These remote workers are going to get massacred, either with grueling commutes back to the office in a bid to prop up their salary, or find their job gone.

As a shareholder, if the work can be done remotely, find the cheapest human of equal caliber. 

It's going to be biblical.|

That sounds about right.  These anecdotes about 50k salaries are leaving something out.  Most likely substantial gifted downpayment
|It's risky but you discuss it with your bank/mortgage broker, the lender gives you a rate with/without the rental agreements. If your offer is accepted you sign the purchase agreement and then you're on the clock to get tenants before your mortgage kicks in. Some real estate agents will actively help you get tenants for a cut of the first few months if you feel you can't get it done yourself. 

If you're buying rental property with a tenant already in it and you're taking them on as a tenant, then you're already there.|
|Too many people have forgotten this fact. We are positioned to be one of the better places to live in the  very likely event that global warming continues. 

As someone who has never really left his hometown in Southern Ontario, the weather has absolutely changed since I was a kid. It use to get so cold some days that we would stay home from school. -50 wasn't unheard of, and in the time it would take to walk to school, you would get frostbite. 

We use to get heaps of snow every year and build forts on our lawn by just shoveling pathways on them and piling the snow. 

Now, I work for a snow clearing company and most of the time is just putting down salt because of ice, but rarely actually having to pick up a shovel. This will continue, and people in unstable regions will pay whatever cost is required to find a stable home for their kids.|
|Why are Canadian cities shaped, and located, the way they are?

Work.

Everyone thinks they will be remote forever but that's not how humans are designed to interact.

Sooner or later you'll be back in an office somewhere.

And your commute from rural areas is going to suck during the many many whiteouts in the winter, and hitting the highway with every other real-estate genius out there.

So yes, a pullback to levels the local economy can support is in the forecast.  If you can't rent it or afford to own it, price goes down.

|Mortgage rates are what, 2-3%. This is the cheapest loan you can get, paying it down quickly is terrible advice unless it's compared to just keeping the money in your bank account.

You can put that money into any etf and get a better return while keeping some liquidity. You run the risk of the investment going down before you need the money but the steps you have to take to pull a home equity loan and the cost of that loan are offset pretty quickly.

As an example, if you have a 400k mortgage at 3% and you make a lump sum payment of 20k, you will nearly save 20k in interest over 25 years. 20k... so you have doubled your money over 25 years. Congratulations, you have almost offset inflation.|

It already is a "meme" stock. The current price is disconnected from any fundamental value. A lot of day traders play it for swings. Just look at the chart on it from January 2021. It went up crazy amount during the first GME run-up too.
I was just laying out numbers to the previous person about ‚Äúcan‚Äù find a high paying job in Canada. It‚Äôs in reality very very hard. starting a business is a completely different ball game.
I only started investing about 3 years ago when I started my current position. I got stock options and have an automated stock purchasing plan. The stocks are all USD and are worth around 55k. With Covid and my lack of social life I have been investing in Wealth Simple which is about 30k right now. I make over 100k and pay 700$ a month rent so I have been able to put a bunch away. Of my friends I am the one with the largest portfolio.
|Funny how reddit doesn't like your opinion, even though it's true. 

I hate the over priced market as much as anybody else. Bought my first house during covid. The previous owner bought it a few months before covid then sold it to me for 135k more than he paid. That means covid has effectively cost me 135k.

But, like you said, what can they do to drop prices? The older generation in many cases did not save enough for retirement. They will be funding it by cashing in on their real estate gains. If you somehow removed that, things would go south quickly. 

I think at best they can put measures forward to bring the growth back to an acceptable rate and try to increase the availability of 2-3 bedroom high density housing, but that's harder to do than everybody assumes. Even if zoning regulations changed, the builders are going to keep pushing out whatever is the most profitable for them. They're not going to commit several years to one project that might not earn as much as another project, and this isn't communist Russia where the builders can be ordered to act for the greater good of the state.|

|Lol what?! There are more poor Canadians falling from the top percentages to moderate/lower income than before. The banks own everyone's homes, there's no money to shift except from the few multigenerational Canadians, more money comes into the country from foreigners. Us average citizens barely have two coins to rub together. 

Average family size is less, yes. Average family wealth or maybe better understood as average family buying power is probably at all time lows.  

Generally when people can comfortably live with what they earn they have more kids. Nowadays it's too risky to have kids.|
|I think one of two things will happen... either OP is right, or, I think things will actually keep climbing. Just not at such a crazy rate. 

Supply hasn't increased that I know of. Demand hasn't decreased. Canadians have actually *made* money during the pandemic. Global warming is real, people want to move to Canada because it's a stable future. Immigrants will be bringing money and buying real estate because it has been one of the best investments going. 

I actually think a lot of this inflation is just a squeeze due to running out of land to build within a reasonable proximity to downtown. That won't change unless they scrap the greenbelt or others decentralize the job market.|

So it means Canada will introduce negative interest rate soon and potentially a lot of tax benefits to home owners? (I‚Äôll not be surprised if they do tbh)
|How much did you qualify for? Out of curiosity

Qualifications are basically based on debt service ratio, so there would be a reason|
One other factor that is driving exponential growth would be a family of one household that has two kids and when those kids grow up they will then require two additional households from that initial household. This can be further and further multiplied if there‚Äôs 3-4 kids. You will get some households that don‚Äôt have kids but it will only slow down the exponential growth not stop it.
This is the most likely scenario. The second most likely is prices continue to rise for no good reason.

|Vietnam (VNM), India (INDA) and Brazil (EWZ) are currently my three largest regional Emerging/Frontier positions. 

Short term risks for VNM are that it has benefitted from the government's exceptional handling of the pandemic but the vaccination rate is very low and the new variants are threatening to shut down manufacturing in the north. But this will only be a buying opportunity as a longer term trend of international fortune 500 type companies shifting production from China to Vietnam is now in place and will continue for the next decade. Vietnam's GDP is projected to grow at 2.5x the developed world for the next five to ten years. 

The case for buying Brazil (EWZ) last year was similar to that of Canadian O&amp;G - it was trading at a huge discount based on short term collapse in commodity prices (50% of this ETF is commodities, energy and industrials). It has now largely recovered and is only trading about 15% below 2019 highs, BUT the outlook for these companies has improved dramatically. Note that although they are trading at a 21x trailing P/E which seems relatively expensive, I estimated on the back of a napkin the forward P/E for this ETF and it is less than 10x. Despite a huge run Brazil is still dirt cheap.

The case for India is self explanatory.|

Typically the type of people who get these predatory mortgages actually have higher amounts of cash/savings and can be immigrants or refugees from another country. They just dig into their cash reserves. Cash won't typically get you approved for a legitimate mortgage so they go the sketchy route

|You‚Äôre right. The example is rushed. But the point stands. The profit margin is highly increased. Plus when you look at the layout of new developments vs old, it‚Äôs all smaller lots and more towns to squeeze as many homes in as possible.

|I was very surprised to be approved for the amount I received. I applied for the 2018/2019 school year. They gave me a loan and grant that covered the whole semester and left me with a little extra cash. I took a 60% course load. I was truthful with application and didn't lie or manipulate anything. 

At that time Liberal government had passed something to make OSAP more accessible. I am not sure if the Ford government has made changes to that since 2019.I stopped for 2019/2020 due to work commitments and then later due to COVID19 but planning to return for this fall. 

I didn't quite need the money but I wasn't going to say no. However I did notice that they charged the interest right away when I looked at the statement. So I ended up paying back the loan right away. So in the future I would just suggest just taking grants or paying back your loans as soon as possible if you can.|

|You need to understand a few things:
Canada has a vast majority of land which can not be used as farming all year along because of weather conditions that's why we get most of our produce from California and Mexico or just say US, so what can we do on that vacant land the answer is infrastructure either in the for of manufacturing plants, industries, houses, buildings whatever it is (I am not saying every inch of Canada land will be used in these sectors). 
Immigration cannot be halted because it's a great source of money for the government and the big banks for eg : a single student visa will bring around 32000$ to Canada either he/she is coming from China, India , Africa any part ( 20000$ GIC AND 6000$ per semester fee approx.) That's just for one student and we are not talking about other immigration ways like CEC which are probably not that expensive but still count.
So all these people need accommodation either they rent someone's property or buy their own which is not the case except Chinese people because of the economy. There are so many other things which include in the unstoppable housing market but let's just stick to this scenario and I hope this helps. And about the affordability factor I'll just say it all comes to how much you can push yourself because the current housing market is not affordable.|
